    # Overview

    The GetID API allows you to send applications for verification and receive the results.
    Verification results for applications created using our SDKs can also be obtained through the API.

    A verification consists of one or more "checks".
    Different checks require different sets of an applicant's data.

    # Request, response format

    You should use a `Content-Type: application/json` header with all requests.
    Responses return JSON with a consistent structure.

    # Authentication

    The GetID API uses token-based authentication. 
    API tokens must be included in the header of all requests made to the API.

      "Application" is the basic concept used in this API.
      It is a set of data that have to be verified, is being verified or has already been verified.

      It may contain text data of the applicant's profile, image(s) of his/her identity document, selfie of the applicant, as well as additional files.
      Also, if the application was created using our SDK, it may contain artefacts confirm that the applicant passes the liveness check.
  - name: "Translation"
    x-displayName: "Translations"
    description: |
      GetID SDK gets the user's preferred locale or uses the locale passed to its initializer as the default one.
      Then the SDK loads translations for the selected locale from the server.
      It works automatically and doesn't require any additional configuration.

      But one can change some translations if needed.
      In order to do that, one have to upload a "translation dictionary" for one or several locales.
      If the "translation dictionary" name is passed to the SDK initializer, the translations from this dictionary will be used.
      Translations for keys that the dictionary does not contain will be taken from the default GetID dictionary.

      The actual list of supported locales can be obtained using `GET /sdk/v2/locales` method.
      And the actual list of translation keys can be obtained using `GET /sdk/v2/translations` method.
  - name: "Token"
    x-displayName: "Tokens"
    description: |
      One can create a token to avoid using the API key in requests.
      The API key have full access to all methods and data.
      So using tokens with limited access is preferable for security reasons.
